The separation of the `ICorporateRepository` interface from its concrete implementation (`CorporateRepository`) across the `Pricetool.Domain` and `Pricetool.DataAccess` layers is a design choice rooted in the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and the SOLID principles, specifically the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). Here's why this separation is beneficial:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - `Pricetool.Domain` is concerned with defining the core business rules, entities, and contracts (interfaces). It should be independent of external concerns like data persistence, which is a detail.
   - `Pricetool.DataAccess` is concerned with the implementation details of data access, such as how to interact with a database using Entity Framework.

2. **Dependency Direction**: 
   - By placing the interface in the domain layer and the implementation in the data access layer, you ensure that the data access layer depends on the domain layer and not the other way around. This adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, which states that high-level modules (like domain/business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (like data access), but both should depend on abstractions (interfaces).

3. **Flexibility & Testability**: 
   - By depending on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, it becomes easier to swap out or change the data access logic without affecting the domain layer. For example, if you decide to switch from Entity Framework to Dapper or another ORM, you can do so without changing the domain layer.
   - It also makes unit testing easier. When testing domain logic, you can mock the repository interface without needing the actual database implementation.

4. **Clear Boundaries**: 
   - Keeping the interface in the domain layer and the implementation in the data access layer establishes clear boundaries between different parts of the application. This separation makes it clear where certain responsibilities lie and helps maintain a modular and maintainable codebase.

In summary, while it's technically possible to place both the interface and its implementation in the `Pricetool.DataAccess` layer, separating them provides architectural benefits that make the system more maintainable, flexible, and testable.
